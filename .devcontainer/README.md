# Dev Container Configuration

This directory contains the Development Container configuration for VS Code.

The dev container provides a consistent .NET 10 development environment with all necessary tools pre-installed. The project supports multi-targeting (builds for .NET 8, 9, and 10), so a single .NET 10 SDK is sufficient for all development work.

## Documentation

See [../docs/DevContainers.md](../docs/DevContainers.md) for complete setup and usage instructions.
